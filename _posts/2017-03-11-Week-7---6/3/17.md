  <tr>
    <td>As always I learnt with the book which gives extra information that is useful to understand what I am doing rather the being a robot and doing everything it tells me to do. We nearly made it to using the LEDs which will include pictures. We just ran out of time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes I did not read all of the extra information and just got on the work so when it comes to programming the robot arm I might not be as good as I could be. Also I need to stop talking to my partner about the work, we know how to work together so we should just work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To work better next time I will make sure I read everything before doing the work. Also I will talk to my partner before the lesson and make sure we know not to talk to each other or anyone else or the work.</td>
