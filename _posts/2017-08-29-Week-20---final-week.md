    <td>this lesson I talked to my teacher quite a bit about what grades meant and how they affect students. We talked about how he thinks grades should not be given as they sometimes can make the students feel like they aren't good enough. That's why he he said that he didn't give his students grades. He said what grade do you think you are and I said C. We talked about if I learnt much this year and I decided that I had. Even though I may not be good at it I feel more confident.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I may have got more work done had I not talk to the teacher, but talking to the teacher made me realise what I've actually learnt this year. It shows me that the grades are only there to show you what level you are that confidence cannot be measured in grades.</td>

    <td>I am hoping next year that I will find the topics easier. I found codecademy quite hard because I'm not the best at coding. I will work harder in lessons because sometimes in this year I got distracted I didn't get all the work done I could've done. I learned quite a bit in IT this year but not as much as I would've liked. </td>
