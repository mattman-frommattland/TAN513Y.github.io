In the past three lessons we have done several thing. Firstly we started with python with turtle. This is basically python but you can draw things with it. In the first lesson we were just getting to grips learning how to draw basic shapes. Like squares and triangles. In the second lesson, we began to learn python 3. This was more to do with coding without pictures. We learnt how to ask questions and ask for an answer. For example, I asked the question of what is the best football team. I made my answer Fulham. If you were to answer anything other than Fulham you would've had a different answer, but because I put Fulham, I got the answer "yes they are the best". In the last lesson, we were back on python with turtle. This time we were trying to make a 3-D shape. This was quite hard as there are obviously more than two dimensions. I have nearly finished it. We were making the T.
