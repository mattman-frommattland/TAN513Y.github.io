**Year 9 -- Week 1 - 27/11/17**

Today we learnt about the basics of how a spreadsheets could be used in a shop. Eg. to show stock and prices and then be able to find the stock and price with ease. To do this we had to use the following:

=iferror(vlookup(D3,$A3:$B30,2,False),) This is used to search for the certain product and automatically show it's price

	D3 tells the computer to see what is in that cell

$A3:$B30 tells the computer to search in that area of cells for the corresponding product and then it's price

Those are the most important bits of the [=iferror(vlookup(D3,$A3:$B30,2,False),)]
