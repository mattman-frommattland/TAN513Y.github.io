  <tr>
    <td>I followed the instructions carefully this lesson which helped me to progress a lot. Unfortunately I had to miss about half of the lesson because of a music lesson so I couldn't progress as much as I would've liked. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well, as I had a saxophone lesson in the IT lesson I couldn't progress as far as I could. It also meant that I tried to work a lot quicker than normal meaning that I struggled more with some of the exercises and I didn't manage to take in all of the information. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and take in more of the information and work at a slower pace meaning that I can work better. Also I will try to not have music lesson sun my IT lesson to stop any problems with not getting enough work done. </td>
