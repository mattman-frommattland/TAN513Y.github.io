Today we learnt how computers sort of digest the coding they get given. We were asked to explain how to make a cup of tea. Everyone failed because it wasn't clear enough. Computers work with 1's and 0â€™s. True and false. Yes and no. We had a long conversation about controlling a robot arm with rotating motors and making a cup of tea. Everything we mentioned related to our coding, helping most of us understand how computers think, and where we are going wrong. I hope this helps me next week in progressing further.
