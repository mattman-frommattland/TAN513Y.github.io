This week we carried on doing similar thing to last week. I had to fix some things I done as it was not working properly. It is quite easy to make a mistake in the coding. In my "vlookup" a part of the coding was wrong so it didn't work properly. I then added on something where you can search up the item and find the price, then type in the quantity and get a total. This would make it easier in a real shop because you can just quickly get a drop-down bar and type in the concert next to it and you get your full total for example: iPhone 6s is £359.99 and if I got two of those it would automatically give me the answer of £719.98. Next lesson I will hope to progress to add new things to the spreadsheet.
