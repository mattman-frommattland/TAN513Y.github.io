    <td>I found it much easier to learn when I was working in a pair with my classmate. There are also people in the class who could help me when I got stuck as they had already been through that exercise. For example on one of the exercises I was going completely the wrong direction when somebody came along and said that I was going in the wrong direction and I nearly had it, and then I was able to solve it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on focusing. It's quite hard as I can in a hot stuffy room where it is hard to focus but everyone else can do it fine. I need to be able to cope with my surroundings as it can distract me causing me to not be able to focus on the coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will bring a bottle of water to the lesson so when I am feeling like I can't concentrate I will quickly go out of the room to have a drink. I will also try to use people in the class list to help me with the work as I should be focusing on the work a lot easier than I have been.</td>
