  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that it was useful to work apart from the person next to me. He can easily distract me and he can be very annoying. It is easier without him. Also, reading the information above is incredibly useful, as it can help on future exercises.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to move places as people around me are being annoying and I am not focussing hard enough. I am also sometimes not reading all of the information and just trying to do the work as quickly as I can which is not good. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and move places and not talk to anybody. I will also think about making sure to learn everything, and not just progress. Also I will try to think more carefully, rather than just asking for help from others.</td>
