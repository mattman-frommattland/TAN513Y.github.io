    <td>We tried the same code again without changing it and it worked! It must have been some bug in our other monitor or fuse box. Someone from another group decided to help us even though I do not believe we needed it. They explained how to use it and helped write the code. Me and my partner worked really well today as I forced him not to sit next to his friends so we could get work done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think we took too much time at the start so we did not have as much time at the end to play with the robot arm. The reason for that is it took too long for us to start work and It also took a while because I was trying to make my partner sit somewhere else, which eventually worked.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will ignore what he says about "sitting next to friends" and just start work without him, so he comes and joins me. Also I will try and set up quicker so we get more time to play around with it.</td>
