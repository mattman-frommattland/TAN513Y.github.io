  <tr>
    <td>Our teacher gave us an introduction to codecademy and told us how to use it. That helped as then we knew what we were doing. Also, the person sat next to me can help and we are proceeding on with the work helping each other.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to focus on my work, not looking around trying to see what everyone else is doing. Also I think I will try and work on my own next week as I think that would be better for me rather than possibly being distracted by the person next to me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am going to sit in a corner of the classroom focussing on my own work and nobody else's. Also I will try really hard not to talk to anyone during the lesson so I can do more work than other people who are getting distracted. </td>
