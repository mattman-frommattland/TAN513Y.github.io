    <td>I and my partner have been struggling a lot with the LEDs. It did not help that the teacher was not in the lesson so we were getting a lot of advice from fellow classmates as to how it worked, and why ours was not working. We have checked the code with other people and it is exactly the same as theirs but it still does not work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We should probably start again and re-write our code just to double check. If that doesn't work we will get the teacher to help us. Also I need to stop relying on other groups to help when I am stuck. My partner has gone off track again and I need to get him back into it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will re-write the code to make sure we have done it write. I will also include my partner more and stop relying on other students to help. They have their own work to do. Finally if the code does still not work, I will ask my teacher what is wrong.</td>
