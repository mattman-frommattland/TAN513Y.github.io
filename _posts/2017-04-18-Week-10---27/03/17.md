  <tr>
    <td>The rest of the class helped us if we got stuck but we hardly ever did. In fact, I do not think we actually got help during the lesson. Me and my partner just carried on with the robot arm, playing games and making it do cool things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that we got a bit distracted messing around with the robot arm not doing productive things, like taking my glasses off. If we had been trying to pick things up or draw things that would have been better.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and be more sensible and try to do more things that I will learn from. Like droawing something.</td>
