  <tr>
    <td>I felt like I knew what I was doing more this lesson. I could just read the booklet and work through it. As ever though, trial and error was useful and if something did not work, there is always another way. That was useful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make my partner do more, he is still getting distracted. That is very frustrating because it is quicker with two people focused. Also I need to accelerate my working more, I feel like I am working quite slowly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make me and my partner sit away from any distractions and get him to start off working. To work faster I will sit further away from anyone else and get my partner to help me to stay on topic. I will also make him stay on topic.</td>
