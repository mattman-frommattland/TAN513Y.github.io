    <td>Reading the booklet is always helpful. It gives the extra information that is needed for me to understand what I am typing. I feel using past knowledge from previous lessons is very useful in progressing faster.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to stop wanting to lay back and relax and let my partner do it for me. This doesn't often happen but I do need to cut it down to never happening. Also we need to blank out the rest of the class and just focus on the work. It is getting better but could still be improved.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will sit in a corner of the class and focus on the fuse box only. We will work very speedily and get through as much as possible with time to test what we have created during the lesson.</td>
