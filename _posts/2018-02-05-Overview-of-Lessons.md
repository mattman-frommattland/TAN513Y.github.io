Overview of Lessons

We learnt how to embed YouTube videos. You need to copy the video and make sure it comes up with the iFrame at the start. After this we then checked our blogs to see if they were working and changing backgrounds. I changed my background and checked everything and it was working fine. 

Then we were told making several sheets would be helpful so I began making some. I now have the projections, discount & the main sheet. This is useful as the main sheet won't get overcrowded. I think my sheet is going quite well and Iâ€™m pleased with it.
